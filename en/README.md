1. Before you start, you will need an App Inventor Account. You can use the one in the Beginner App Inventor Sushi. If you haven't done that Sushi you can follow it here: \[dojo.soy/BeginnerAppInventor\]\(http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Beginner\_App\_Inventor\_Sushi\). 

2. **You may need help form a mentor for this step!** If you have an emulator or devices from the Beginner App Inventor Sushi setup (or a Dojo device), awesome! If not, follow the appropriate links and use the App Inventor team's instructions for your device or emulator. 

3. Perfect! You are set up to make your own Android mini games in App Inventor!

4. In the App Inventor browser page click the "Start new project" button (its on the top left of the screen).
