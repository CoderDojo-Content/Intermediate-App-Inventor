1. You can always add more games yourself. Just remember to increase the number of games variable on Screen1!
 
  Some ideas for games are:
  
  Change up the list minigame. Try to make the game select a random item in the list, tell the layer to click it, and see if the player picked the right choice.
  
  Play around with other **Media** options. You can have the player take a picture of themselves with the camera blocks.
  
  See if the player can tap a button 5 times in a second.
  
  You can always make up your own games. Don't be afraid to get silly and try putting some blocks together!
